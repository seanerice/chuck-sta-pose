# Gesture Classification
Wekinator allows me to classify multiple, complex gestures.

Some gestures are:

`raise_arm`: Raise the volume of a single voice
* Use `hand_y` parameter to control volume
* Use some other parameter to determine which voice is selected

`lower_arm`: Lower the volume of a single voice
* Same as `raise_arm`

`arms_wide`: Controll all voices simultaneously

`inward_circle`: Used to note a sudden "closing" or cut-off.

Note: I may use two classifiers (one for left, one for right)
