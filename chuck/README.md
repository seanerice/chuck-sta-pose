## Audio Backend
A composed chuck piece consisting of several audio sources.

There are two scripts in the audio engine:

`main.ck`: 
* Audio sources
* OSC event listeners (note trigger, instrument params)
    
`composition.ck`: 
* High-level control of audio sources
* Several distinct sections
* OSC event listeners (gesture data, gesture parameters)
